## Abstract
In recent times, the pervasive influence of social media has been harnessed by various factions representing diverse religions and backgrounds, unfortunately resulting in a disturbing weaponization of these platforms. Tragically, this has led to the incitement of hatred, which, in turn, has manifested as physical communal violence causing significant loss of life and widespread destruction. The prevalence of communal violence is a longstanding issue that continues to escalate, not only in the Bengal Region, encompassing Bangladesh and the West Bengal Province of India, but also worldwide.

Against this backdrop, it becomes imperative to address and understand the different manifestations of communal violence. To this end, this shared task aims to categorize and discern various forms of communal violence, aiming to shed light on this complex phenomenon and contribute to its mitigation.
